# Progressive Budget Tracker

- I was tasked with converting a pre-built budget tracking application into a progressive web app
- I used IndexedDB to allow for any budget submissions from the user to be saved in storage when the user's internet connection is offline and then successfully posted once their internet comes back online.
- I used a service worker to allow for the app to be viewed even when the user's internet connection is offline
- As well I added a manifest.json file to the app to allow the user to install the budget tracker as a chrome application
- Finally I deployed the app to heroku with it's mongodb database connected
